## Christopher Glenn's Code Challenge

Just like the directions stated I created a very basic API. I used Node.js and a few packages such as express, geolib, and cvs-parser.

### Instructions
* open git
* npm i
* node server.js

Your server should be located on localhost:3000

To make a get request using your coordinates will be in the format:

localhost:3000/api/latitude/longitude

e.g. http://localhost:3000/api/38.593475/-94.965769
